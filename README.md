# KwikFood - Online Canteen Project

KwikFood is a web-based platform built using ReactJS for the front-end and Nhost cloud-based for the back-end. The platform uses PostgreSQL and GraphQL APIs provided by Nhost to facilitate the development process. It is accessible from any device with an internet connection and has a user-friendly and easy to navigate interface.

## Technologies and Frameworks

- ReactJS for the front-end
- Nhost cloud-based for the back-end
- PostgreSQL and GraphQL APIs provided by Nhost
- Replit for front-end deployment

## Scalability

To ensure that the KwikFood platform can handle a high volume of traffic and data, we are using Nhost as a cloud-based hosting provider and Replit for front-end deployment. This allows us to scale up or down the platform's resources as needed, ensuring that it remains fast and responsive for our users.
